# Python Installation Guide for Windows

Welcome to the Python Installation Guide for Windows! This guide will walk you through the steps to install Python on a Windows machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Windows computer with an internet connection
- Administrative access to the computer

## Step 1: Download Python Installer

1. Open your web browser and go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. Navigate to the Downloads section and select the latest stable release for Windows.
3. Click on the link to download the installer.

## Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Locate the downloaded installer file (e.g., `python-3.x.x.exe`) in your Downloads folder.
2. Double-click the installer to run it.

## Step 3: Customize Installation (Optional)

1. In the installer window, check the box that says `Add Python to PATH`. This will make it easier to run Python from the command line.
2. Click on `Customize installation` if you want to select optional features or specify an installation location. Otherwise, click `Install Now`.

## Step 4: Complete Installation

1. Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take a few minutes.
2. Once the installation is finished, click `Close`.

## Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Open Command Prompt (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`).
2. Type `python --version` and press `Enter`. You should see the installed Python version, confirming the installation was successful.
3. Type `pip --version` to verify that pip, the Python package installer, is also installed.

## Step 6: Install a Python Package (Optional)

1. To ensure pip is working correctly, try installing a package. For example, type `pip install requests` and press `Enter`.
2. If the installation is successful, you have set up Python correctly on your Windows machine!
